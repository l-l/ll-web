The Algorithm represents the core device for digital manifestations. It bears resemblance both with a magic spell and a ritual if we consider it from a potential perspective of language and myth.

unformation? the yielding unknown

>What moves poeple's hearts, in every case, is the unknown. Things that people already know don't excite them.
>*Kenya Hara, Ex-Formation*

 The unknown is a volatile state because it represents something unsettled, it constantly strives to become known.
 In order to make it known we need to take it apart and link it to our current understanding.
 The creation of links and relations to something we already know is very strong - it is a process of integration, it elevates our self by making it our consciousness more complex (> Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi). It unifies our self with the subject, history, concepts, people and objects and represents a form of enlightenment. 
 
 When something becomes ordinary it ceases to produce this sensation. Instead of integration this represents a process of distinctionA desirable unknownThere is of course a kind of Unknown that is too detached from our consciousness. One which doesn't resemble anything we know, doesn't share any links or decodeable information.
 Such an Unknown is noise or entropy. It serves a purpose in itself by representing void or emptiness but is useless for our quest for the construction of the "Teeming Unknown"
 
 Arrangement, Collage and Context
 
 We aim for the far-fetched, the long-distance short circuitsSymbolism connects a thing to a concept. Through symbolification an object becomes extraordinary it begins to exist in a different realm where different connections are possible. modes of existence: eg apple
	* actual (fruit, food, organic)
	* formal (spherical, round; size, color)
	* symbolic, allegoric, metaphoric (sin, paradise, fertility...)
	* myth, narrative (newton)
	* specific (company, adam's apple body part, augapfel,...)

About Expectations

People tend to delight in the expected. A transformation of the description of the thing into an experience of the thing. the safe place that doesn't challenge us with surprises. Kenya Hara, Ex-Formation
