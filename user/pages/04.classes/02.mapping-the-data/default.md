#Leonhard Lass
<span class='leadP'> 
Leonhard Lass (1978) deals with the poetic potential of multimedia systems. His work explores the ritual character of the post-digital and strives towards a complex individual experience. Since 1999, he has been working with Gregor Ladenhauf as [Depart](http://depart.at) on audiovisual installations and performances. 
He also teaches “Mapping the Data” at the University of Art and Design Linz and “Generative Art” at the FH Hagenberg.
